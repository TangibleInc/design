            Three fundamental aspects of typography are legibility, readability,
            and aesthetics. Although in a non-technical sense “legible” and
            “readable” are often used synonymously, typographically they are
            separate but related concepts.

          <Text as="p">
            Legibility describes how easily individual characters can be
            distinguished from one another. It is described by Walter Tracy as
            “the quality of being decipherable and recognisable”. For instance,
            if a “b” and an “h”, or a “3” and an “8”, are difficult to
            distinguish at small sizes, this is a problem of legibility.

          <Text as="p">
            Typographers are concerned with legibility insofar as it is their
            job to select the correct font to use. Brush Script is an example of
            a font containing many characters that might be difficult to
            distinguish. The selection of cases influences the legibility of
            typography because using only uppercase letters (all-caps) reduces
            legibility.
