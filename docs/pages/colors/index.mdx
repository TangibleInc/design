# Radix Colors

Here is the default set of colors based on [Radix UI Colors](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors).

Colors can be imported separately as needed, even combined with other sets of colors. They're all optional and  meant for defining semantic tokens such as theme and component variables.

## Gradations

A color has gradations from `1` up to `12`, from light to dark. In dark mode, they go dark to light.
